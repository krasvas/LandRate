LandRate toolbox is a complete post-experimental eye tracking analysis tool developed using the scripting language of MATLAB from MathWorks. The toolbox has been designed to be adapted in every eye tracking device, while its execution is completed in one simple step. LandRate toolbox constitutes an extension of EyeMMV toolbox (Krassanakis et al., 2014) and supports the generation of a full analysis report (including heatmaps, scanpath visualizations and AOI analysis) based on experimental data collected through eye tracking methods. Additionally, the toolbox supports the computation of a new aggregated index (LRI - Landscape Rating Index) appropriate for the performance of landscape rating procedures (Krassanakis et al., 2018). This index combines both quantitative eye tracking metrics and experts’ opinions while it can be easily adapted in similar fields.

A list of demo data is available with LandRate toolbox in order to help you to prepare your experimental data set before running the toolbox. Please, place your input files at the same
folder with LandRate's functions. After the preparation of your data, please execute "LandRate" m-file in order to run the toolbox.
